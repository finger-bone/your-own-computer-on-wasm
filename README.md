# Your Own Computer on WASM

This is an educational project to demonstrate the basics of writing emulators. The goal of this project is to design and emulate a simple computer system, design and implement an assembler for it, and in the end, write a high-level language compiler for it.

The whole emulator will be written in rust with wasm bridge. Then it will be compiled to wasm and be visualized in a web page.

Tutorials will come soon. The Chinese version is under the ch folder, posted on [ZhiHu](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/689329063).

Currently, the code is up to step 5. An assembler has been implemented.
