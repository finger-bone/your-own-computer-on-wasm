# Your Own Computer on WASM

This is an educational project to demonstrate the basics of writing emulators. The goal of this project is to design and emulate a simple computer system, design and implement an assembler for it, and in the end, write a high-level language compiler for it.

The whole emulator will be written in rust with wasm bridge. Then it will be compiled to wasm and be visualized in a web page.

The project is divided into 

1. Design an Instruction Set
2. Design a CPU
3. Design a Computer System
4. Implement the Emulator
5. Implement an Assembler
6. Design an Intermediate Language
7. Implement a Compiler for IL
8. Design a High-Level Language
9. Implement a Compiler for High-Level Language

Tutorials will come soon.

Currently, the code is up to step 5. An assembler has been implemented.
